What are the threats SUBJECT is susceptible to describe each threat with the title of the threat, the description of why it is a threat, what tactics, techniques, and procedures would be used by attackers to exploit the threat, what the ease of exploiting (for example exploitation due to publicly available code or proof of concept to carry out the exploitation), what the impact if the threat was successfully exploited, and what mitigations can be used to prevent the threat from being exploited. 

The types of threats include software-centric, attacker-centric, and asset-centric. Do not mention the same threat more than once.

Include all applicable mitigation strategies involving a combination of technological solutions, secure configuration practices, and ongoing monitoring and response processes within the identified could provider or data center ecosystem like Cloudflare for CDN, DDoS, API and WAF, next-generation firewall such as Palo Alto, web applications firewall, next-generation firewall, Content Delivery Network (Cloudflare, CloudFront, Google Cloud Platform, Azure Content Delivery Network), malware or virus detection gateway (e.g., Palo Alto Wildguard), NDR, XDR, MDR, RBAC, non-repudiation, mutual TLS, TLS 1.2 or greater, network or micro-segmentation, Network Behavioral Analysis, User and Entity Behavior Analysis, Security Incident and Event Management, centralized logging (e.g., Splunk, Datadog), secure coding practices, SCA, SAST, DAST, Code Repository, Defender for Cloud, Defender for O365, Defender for Endpoint, (feel free to identify additional mitigation strategy to mitigate the identified threat.)  

Where applicable, mitigations involving TLS compliance should be TLS 1.2 or greater using only the strong cipher suites.

Where applicable, involving API, Web Application, or Distributed Denial of Service, the mitigations should be using Cloudflare, Cloudfront with AWS WAF enabled, or AWS Load Balancer with AWS WAF enabled plus with AWS Shield for API, Web Application, and DDoS protection. 

When determining threats, also include actual exploits that led to compromises in addition to the proof-of-concept and theoretical threats.

For ease of exploitation, assume minimal safeguards and the highest likelihood (low, moderate, or high) with all threats. Also, identify if the possibility of exploitation is based on real-world scenarios, proof-of-concept, or theoretical.

Provide examples of with emphasis on active and real-world exploitation that are specific to the identified threat.

Use the following format:
## Threat: (title) ##

**Description:** (Description)

**Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
- **Tactic(s):**
- **Technique(s):**
- **Procedure(s):**

**Ease of exploitation:** (exploitation)

**Real-World Example:** (Also cite a reference to a real-world event in which the threat was used to carry out a compromise, breach, or exploit. Use the most notable and well-known as well as relevant to the identified threat.)

**Impact if Exploited:** (impact)

**Threat Actor:**
Identify the potential threat actors (e.g., insider, outsider, nation-state, cybercriminal). Understanding the threat actor helps in tailoring defenses and prioritizing mitigations.

**Attack Vector:** Specify the attack vector or entry point through which the threat actor can exploit the vulnerability (e.g., email, web application, network).

**Detection and Response:** Include specific measures for detecting threats and responding to incidents. This could involve monitoring strategies, alerting mechanisms, and incident response plans.

**Likelihood:** Assess the likelihood of the threat occurring. This can be qualitative (e.g., low, medium, high) or quantitative (e.g., probability percentages). Combining this with the impact assessment helps in risk prioritization.

**Dependencies:** Identify any dependencies or preconditions required to exploit the threat (e.g., specific software versions, network configurations).

**Mitigation(s):**
